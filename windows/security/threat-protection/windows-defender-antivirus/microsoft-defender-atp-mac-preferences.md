# Set preferences for Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) for Mac](microsoft-defender-atp-mac.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This topic contains instructions for how to set preferences for Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac in enterprise environments. If you are interested in configuring the product on a device from the command-line, please refer to the [Resources](microsoft-defender-atp-mac-resources.md#configuring-from-the-command-line) page.

In enterprise environments, Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac can be managed through a configuration profile. This profile is deployed from management tool of your choice. Preferences managed by the enterprise take precedence over the ones set locally on the device. In other words, users in your enterprise are not able to change preferences that are set through this configuration profile.

This topic describes the structure of this profile (including a recommended profile that you can use to get started) and instructions for how to deploy the profile.

## Configuration profile structure

The configuration profile is a .plist file that consists of entries identified by a key (which denotes the name of the preference), followed by a value, which depends on the nature of the preference. Values can either be simple (such as a numerical value) or complex, such as a nested list of preferences.

The top level of the configuration profile includes product-wide preferences and entries for subareas of the product, which are explained in more detail in the next sections.

### Antivirus engine preferences

The *antivirusEngine* section of the configuration profile is used to manage the preferences of the antivirus component of the product.

|||

## Recommended configuration profile

To get started, we recommend the following configuration profile for your enterprise to take advantage of all protection features that Microsoft Defender ATP provides.

The following configuration profile will:
- Enable real-time protection (RTP)
- Specify how the following threat types are handled:
  - **Potentially unwanted applications (PUA)** are blocked
  - **Archive bombs** (file with a high compression rate) are audited to the product logs
- Enable cloud delivered protection
- Enable automatic sample submission

## Configuration profile deployment

Once you've built the configuration profile for your enterprise, you can deploy it through the management console that your enterprise is using. The following sections provide instructions on how to deploy this profile using JAMF and Intune.

### JAMF deployment

From the JAMF console, open **Computers** > **Configuration Profiles**, navigate to the configuration profile you'd like to use, then select **Custom Settings**. Create an entry with *com.microsoft.wdav* as the preference domain and upload the .plist produced earlier.

>[!CAUTION]
>You must enter the correct preference domain (*com.microsoft.wdav*), otherwise the preferences will not be recognized by the product.

### Intune deployment

1. Open **Manage** > **Device configuration**. Select **Manage** > **Profiles** > **Create Profile**.

2. Choose a name for the profile. Change **Platform=macOS** to **Profile type=Custom**. Select Configure.

3. Save the .plist produced earlier as **com.microsoft.wdav.xml**.

4. Enter **com.microsoft.wdav** as the **custom configuration profile name**.

5. Open the configuration profile and upload **com.microsoft.wdav.xml**. This file was created in step 3.

6. Select **OK**.

7. Select **Manage** > **Assignments**. In the **Include** tab, select **Assign to All Users & All devices**.

>[!CAUTION]
>You must enter the correct custom configuration profile name, otherwise these preferences will not be recognized by the product.
