# Windows Defender Antivirus

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Windows Defender Antivirus is a built-in antimalware solution that provides next generation protection for desktops, portable computers, and servers.

Windows Defender Antivirus includes:
- [Cloud-delivered protection](utilize-microsoft-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) for near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. Along with machine learning and the Intelligent Security Graph, cloud-delivered protection is part of the next-gen technologies that power Windows Defender Antivirus. 
- [Always-on scanning](configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md), using advanced file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as "real-time protection")
- [Dedicated protection updates](manage-updates-baselines-windows-defender-antivirus.md) based on machine-learning, human and automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research

Windows Defender Antivirus uses multiple detection and prevention technologies to deliver accurate, real-time, and intelligent protection.
