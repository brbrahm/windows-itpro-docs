# Incidents in Microsoft Defender ATP
**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)


When a cybersecurity threat is emerging, or a potential attacker is deploying its tactics, techniques/tools, and procedures (TTPs) on the network, Microsoft Defender ATP will quickly trigger alerts and launch matching automatic investigations. 

Microsoft Defender ATP applies correlation analytics and aggregates all related alerts and investigations into an incident. Doing so helps narrate a broader story of an attack, thus providing you with the right visuals (upgraded incident graph) and data representations to understand and deal with complex cross-entity threats to your organization's network.
