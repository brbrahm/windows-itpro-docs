When you attempt to install&nbsp;the Windows 10, version 1903 update on a Windows 10-based computer with an affected driver version, the installation process stops and you get a message like the following:</div><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">AMD Ryzen™ or AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ configured in SATA or NVMe RAID mode.</div><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">“A driver is installed that causes stability problems on Windows. This driver will be disabled. Check with your software/driver provider for an updated version that runs on this version of Windows.”</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div>To safeguard your update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these AMD drivers from being offered Windows 10, version 1903, until&nbsp;this issue is resolved.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Affected platforms:</strong></div><ul><li>Client: Windows 10, version 1903</li></ul><div></div><div><strong>Resolution: </strong>This issue has been resolved externally by AMD. To resolve this issue, you will need to download the latest AMD RAID drivers directly from AMD at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/amd-socket-tr4/x399\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/amd-socket-tr4/x399</a>. The drivers must be version&nbsp;9.2.0.105 or later. Install the drivers on the affected computer, and then restart the installation process for the Windows 10, version 1903 feature update.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Note</strong> The safeguard hold will remain in place on machines with the older AMD RAID drivers. We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update using the <strong>Update now</strong> button or the Media Creation Tool until a new driver has been installed and the Windows 10, version 1903 feature update has been automatically offered to you.</div><br><a href ='#466msg'>Back to top</a></td><td>OS Build 18362.116<br><br>May 21, 2019<br><a href ='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4505057' target='_blank'>KB4505057</a></td><td>Resolved<br><a href = '' target='_blank'></a></td><td>Resolved:<br>June 06, 2019 <br>11:06 AM PT<br><br>Opened:<br>May 21, 2019 <br>07:12 AM PT</td></tr>
