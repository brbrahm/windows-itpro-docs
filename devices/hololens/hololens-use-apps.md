# Use apps on HoloLens

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps with 2D view look like windows, and apps with holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

## Open apps

You'll find your apps either pinned to Start or in the All apps list. To get to the All apps list, use the bloom gesture to go to Start, then select **All apps**.

On Start or in the All apps list, select an app. It will open in a good position for viewing.

>[!NOTE]
>- Up to three 2D app windows can be active at a time. You can open more, but only three will remain active.
>- Each open app can have one active window at a time, except Microsoft Edge, which can have up to three.
>- If you're having problems with apps, make sure there's enough light in your space, and walk around so HoloLens has a current scan. If you keep having trouble, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq) for more info.

## Move, resize, and rotate apps

After opening an app, you can [change its position and size](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12634).

## Close apps

To close an app that uses 2D view, gaze at it, then select **Close**.

To close an app that uses holographic view, use the bloom gesture to leave holographic view, then select **Close**.
