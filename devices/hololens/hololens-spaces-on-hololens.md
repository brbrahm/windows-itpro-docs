# Spaces on HoloLens

HoloLens blends holograms with your world, mapping your surroundings to remember where you place your apps and content.

>[!NOTE]
>For your HoloLens to work properly, HoloLens Wi-Fi needs to be turned on, though it doesn't have to be connected to a network.

## Tips for setting up your space

HoloLens works best in certain kinds of environments. Choose a room with adequate light and plenty of space. Avoid dark spaces and rooms with a lot of dark, shiny, or translucent surfaces (for instance, mirrors or gauzy curtains).

>[!NOTE]
>HoloLens is optimized for indoor use. Use it in a safe place with no tripping hazards. [More on safety](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023454/safety-information).

## Mapping your space

When HoloLens starts mapping your surroundings, you'll see a mesh graphic spreading over the space.

To help HoloLens learn a space, walk around the space and gaze around you. Air tap in a space to light up the mesh and see what's been mapped.

If your space changes significantly—for example, if a piece of furniture is moved—you might need to walk around the space and gaze around you so HoloLens can relearn it.

>[!NOTE]
>If HoloLens is having trouble mapping your space or you're have difficulty placing holograms, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq).
