# Get apps for HoloLens

The Microsoft Store is your source for apps and games that work with HoloLens. When you go to the Store on your HoloLens, any apps you see there will run on it.

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps with 2D view look like windows and can be positioned all around you. Apps that use holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

## Get apps

Open the Microsoft Store from the Start menu. Then browse for apps and games (or use your voice to search​), select the microphone on the HoloLens keyboard, and start talking.

To download apps, you'll need to be signed in with a Microsoft account. To buy them, you'll need a payment method associated with the Microsoft account you use on your HoloLens. To set up a payment method, go to [account.microsoft.com](http://account.microsoft.com/) and select **Payment & billing** > **Payment options** > **Add a payment option**.

## Find your apps

Once you've installed an app, you'll find it in the All apps list​ (Start  > All apps ). Keep apps handy by [pinning them to Start](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12638).

App updates are automatic, and they're free.

>[!NOTE]
>- To purchase apps in the Store, the billing address for your payment method must match the country or region your HoloLens is set to.
>- Some apps may not be available in all countries and regions.
